Yelper
======

How many hours did it take to complete?

5 


Search results page

Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints

Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).



Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.

The filters you should actually have are: sort (best match, distance, highest rated) deals (on/off).

The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.

You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.

Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
